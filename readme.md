# 🧱 Boilerplates 

Welcome to my **Boilerplate Repository**, where I keep all the stuff I’m too lazy to set up over and over again 💤

I got tired of manually setting up project structures, installing the same packages, and configuring the same tools for every new idea. So I made this repo to save time—and maybe help others too!

> **Because tidy code, clear mind ;)**

## 🚀 What's Inside?

### ✅ Available Templates

- **Python Websockets Starter**  
  A neat Python boilerplate with `websockets`, ready to go for building real-time apps or bots!

### ⏳ Coming Soon

- More languages, more stacks, and more structure! I'm actively adding templates I often use.

## 👀 Looking for Express.js with TypeScript?

I’ve got that too! Check out my Express TypeScript template here:

## 📦 What's Included in Each Template?

Each template usually comes with:
- A clean folder structure
- Commonly used packages
- Config files for linters, formatters, and environment setup
- Some useful starter code to get you going fast

## 🤝 Contributions?

Not at the moment—this is just my personal stash—but feel free to fork or get inspired!

## 💬 Why?

I believe good boilerplates = less stress and more clarity.  
So yeah, build something cool and don’t get stuck on setup again.

Cheers,
